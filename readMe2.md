## Admin panel
My Village is a platform intended to connect all players in the entrepreneurial ecosystem. The platform has the following modules: startups for business entity registration, community that is a collection of all users that have sign-up to the platform who are sub categorized into developers and freelancers. The platform also provides a place for the members to post job adverts and upcoming events and a feed to express themselves in form of feed posts. 

### Major Functionalities:
* Content Management: This will involve creation of a user interface that will enable an administrator to modify or remove content from any parts of the platform i.e. activity feed, Jobs, Events, freelancer projects.

* Access control This will give the administrator the rights to manage users by blocking, deleting, suspending users who violate the platforms terms and conditions.

### Problem
The platform lacks an administration interface to aid the control and management of the posted content in ways of editing and deleting as well as lacks the ability to manage users by suspending and deleting a user.
Currently this is done through a developer which is both time consuming and not scalable.

### Solution
Development of an administrator interface so that:
● Anyone can perform the above tasks of user management and content control.
● We gain full control of what is posted on the platform.
